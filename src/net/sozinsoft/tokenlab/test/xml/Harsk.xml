                <description>Harsk is, in many ways, not your standard dwarf. He prefers the wide skies of the open
                    plains, disdains the taste of alcohol, and prefers to handle his battles at range rather than in
                    melee. Yet few dare to mock him for his choices, for if there&#8217;s anywhere that Harsk is
                    dwarven, it is in his gruff and off-putting attitude. Much of his anger stems from the slaughter of
                    his brother&#8217;s warband. Harsk came upon the band, slain to a man by giants, moments too late to
                    save his brother. Harsk&#8217;s hatred of giants has fueled him and shapes his life. He prefers
                    strong tea over alcohol (to keep his senses sharp), the wildlands of the surface world (where giants
                    can be found), and the crossbow over the axe (which allows him to start fights faster). His
                    companions value his skill at combat even if they&#8217;re somewhat afraid of him.

                    <description>You can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also
                        dive, flip, jump, and roll to avoid attacks and overcome obstacles.

                        Check: You can use Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A
                        successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces - only one check is
                        needed per round. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is then modified by
                        the Acrobatics skill modifiers noted on page 89. While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you
                        are considered flat-footed and lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC (if any). If you take damage
                        while using Acrobatics, you must immediately make another Acrobatics check at the same DC to
                        avoid falling or being knocked prone.

                <skill name="Appraise" ranks="0" attrbonus="0" attrname="Intelligence" value="0">
                    <description>You can evaluate the monetary value of an object.

                        Check: A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or
                        more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant
                        knowledge of the magic item's abilities. If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine
                        the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more,
                        the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items
                        might increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.

                        You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The
                        DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large
                        hoard.

                        Action: Appraising an item takes 1 standard action. Determining the most valuable object in a
                        treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.

                        Try Again: Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.

                        Special: A spellcaster with a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

                    <description>You know how to tell a lie.

                        Check: Bluff is an opposed skill check against your opponent's Sense Motive skill. If you use
                        Bluff to fool someone, with a successful check you convince your opponent that what you are
                        saying is true. Bluff checks are modified depending upon the believability of the lie. The
                        following modifiers are applied to the roll of the creature attempting to tell the lie. Note
                        that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince anyone that they are true
                        (subject to GM discretion).

                        Circumstances: Bluff Modifier
                        The target wants to believe you: +5
                        The lie is believable: +0
                        The lie is unlikely: -5
                        The lie is far-fetched: -10
                        The lie is impossible: -20
                        The target is drunk or impaired: +5
                        You possess convincing proof: up to +10

                        Feint: You can use Bluff to feint in combat, causing your opponent to be denied his Dexterity
                        bonus to his AC against your next attack. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent's
                        base attack bonus + your opponent's Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense
                        Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent's Sense Motive bonus, if higher. For more
                        information on feinting in combat, see Chapter 8.

                    <description>You are skilled at scaling vertical surfaces, from smooth city walls to rocky cliffs.

                        Check: With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, wall, or
                        other steep incline (or even across a ceiling, provided it has handholds) at one-quarter your
                        normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60
                        degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.

                        A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5
                        or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

                        The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb.

                    <description>You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve
                        differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used
                        to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem.

                        Check: You can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters with a successful check. The
                        DC of this check depends on the creature's starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its
                        Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the character's attitude toward you is improved by one step.
                        For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character's attitude toward you
                        increases by one additional step. A creature's attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up
                        in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations. If you fail the check by
                        4 or less, the character's attitude toward you is unchanged. If you fail by 5 or more, the
                        character's attitude toward you is decreased by one step.

                    <description>You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you
                        sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.

                        Check: When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that
                        you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded.

                        The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it
                        fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes
                        wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you
                        think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

                        You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and
                        then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

                    <description>You are skilled at changing your appearance.

                        Check: Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by
                        others' Perception check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get
                        to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a
                        guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such
                        observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.

                        You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people make Perception
                        checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the

                        The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you're changing your appearance. Disguise
                        can be used to make yourself appear like a creature that is one size category larger or smaller
                        than your actual size. This does not change your actual size or reach, should you enter combat
                        while wearing such a disguise.

                    <description>Your training allows you to slip out of bonds and escape from grapples.

                        Check: The table below gives the DCs needed to escape various forms of restraints.
                        Ropes: The DC of your Escape Artist check is equal to the binder's Combat Maneuver Bonus +20.
                        Manacles and Masterwork Manacles: The DC for manacles is set by their construction (see the
                        table below).
                        Tight Space: The DC noted is for getting through a space through which your head fits but your
                        shoulders don't. If the space is long, you may need to make multiple checks. You can't squeeze
                        through a space that your head does not fit through.
                        Grappler: You can make an Escape Artist check in place of a combat maneuver check to escape a
                        grapple (see Chapter 8) or to change from a pinned condition to merely grappled.

                    <description>You are skilled at flying, through either the use of wings or magic, and can perform
                        daring or complex maneuvers while airborne. Note that this skill does not give you the ability
                        to fly.

                        Check: You generally need only make a Fly check when you are attempting a complex maneuver.
                        Without making a check, a flying creature can remain flying at the end of its turn so long as it
                        moves a distance greater than half its speed. It can also turn up to 45 degrees by sacrificing 5
                        feet of movement, can rise at half speed at an angle of 45 degrees, and can descend at any angle
                        at normal speed. Note that these restrictions only apply to movement taken during your current
                        turn. At the beginning of the next turn, you can move in a different direction than you did the
                        previous turn without making a check. Taking any action that violates these rules requires a Fly
                        check.

                        First aid: 15

                        Treat poison: Poison's save DC
                        Treat disease: Disease's save DC

                        First Aid: You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit
                        points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can
                        make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also
                        stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see Appendix 2 for
                        rules on bleed damage).

                        benefits you. This skill includes verbal threats and displays of prowess.

                        Check: You can use Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward you for 1d6 × 10
                        minutes with a successful check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice +
                        the target's Wisdom modifier.

                        If successful, the target gives you the information you desire, takes actions that do not
                        endanger it, or otherwise offers limited assistance. After the Intimidate expires, the target
                        treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities. If you fail this check by 5 or
                        more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities.

                        Demoralize: You can use this skill to cause your opponents to become shaken for a number of
                        rounds. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom
                        modifier. If you are successful, the target is shaken for 1 round. This duration increases by 1
                        round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten opponents in this way if they
                        are within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you.

                        higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the
                        general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check

                        Check: Perception has a number of uses, the most common of which is an opposed check versus an
                        opponent's Stealth check to notice the opponent and avoid being surprised. If you are
                        successful, you notice the opponent and can react accordingly. If you fail, your opponent can
                        take a variety of actions, including sneaking past you and attacking you.

                        Perception is also used to notice fine details in the environment. The DC to notice such details
                        varies depending upon distance, the environment, and how noticeable the detail is.

                        take a -5 penalty on your Ride checks.

                        Check: Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount
                        from a mount without a problem. The following tasks do require checks.

                        Task: Ride DC
                        Guide with knees: 5

                        Cover: 15
                        Soft fall: 15
                        Leap: 15

                        Control mount in battle: 20
                        Fast mount or dismount: 20

                        Guide with Knees: You can guide your mount with your knees so you can use both hands in combat.
                        Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this
                        round because you need to use the other to control your mount. This does not take an action.

                        Stay in Saddle: You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts
                        unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.

                        Fight with a Combat-Trained Mount: If you direct your wartrained mount to attack in battle, you
                        can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.

                        Hunch: This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can

                        an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

                        Sense Enchantment: You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment
                        effect even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated
                        (see dominate person), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's
                        activities.

                    <description>Your training allows you to pick pockets, draw hidden weapons, and take a variety of
                        actions without being noticed.

                        Check: A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a
                        minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an
                        observer is determined to note where the item went.

                        When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's
                        Perception check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just
                        from doing it unnoticed.

                    <description>You are skilled at the art of casting spells, identifying magic items, crafting magic
                        items, and identifying spells as they are being cast.

                        Check: Spellcraft is used whenever your knowledge and skill of the technical art of casting a
                        spell or crafting a magic item comes into question. This skill is also used to identify the
                        properties of magic items in your possession through the use of spells such as detect magic and
                        identify. The DC of this check varies depending upon the task at hand.

                        Action: Identifying a spell as it is being cast requires no action, but you must be able to
                        clearly see the spell as it is being cast, and this incurs the same penalties as a Perception
                        skill check due to distance, poor conditions, and other factors. Learning a spell from a
                        spellbook takes 1 hour per level of the spell (0-level spells take 30 minutes). Preparing a
                        spell from a borrowed spellbook does not add any time to your spell preparation. Making a
                        Spellcraft check to craft a magic item is made as part of the creation process. Attempting to
                        ascertain the properties of a magic item takes 3 rounds per item to be identified and you must
                        be able to thoroughly examine the object.

                    <description>You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip past foes or strike from an
                        unseen position. This skill covers hiding and moving silently.

                        Check: Your Stealth check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone who might notice you. You
                        can move up to half your normal speed and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed
                        greater than half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's impossible to use
                        Stealth while attacking, running, or charging.

                        A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Stealth checks
                        depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8,
                        Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.

                        If people are observing you using any of their senses (but typically sight), you can't use
                        Stealth. Against most creatures, finding cover or concealment allows you to use Stealth. If your
                        observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check), you can attempt to use Stealth.
                        While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Stealth check if you can get
                        to an unobserved place of some kind. This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you
                        have to move fast.

                        excel at following trails and tracks left by others.

                        Check: You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs
                        for various tasks that require Survival checks.

                        Survival DC: Task
                        10: Get along in the wild. Move up to half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no
                        food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2
                        points by which your check result exceeds 10.
                        15: Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to half your
                        overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one
                        other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.
                        15: Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.
                        15: Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival
                        check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.

                    <description>You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.

                        Check: Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim
                        at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move
                        action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go
                        underwater.

                        If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming
                        underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of
                        rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move
                        actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an
                        attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round.
                        (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that
                        period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your
                        breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check,
                        you begin to drown.

                        Check: You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets
                        you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if

                        You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are
                        using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to
                        make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.

                        You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are
                        trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose.

                        or a two-handed firearm.

                        Special: You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a
                        new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.

                        character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved
                        Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at his discretion.
                        The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that
                        give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.

                        An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse
                        feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an
                        unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (see Chapter 8).

                        Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a

                        extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points

                        moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round,

                    <description>A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances.
                        When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment
                        of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming
                        tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack
                        rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor,
                        unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger
                        creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but
                        it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and
                        fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.

                        A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17
                        Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature
                        trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack
                        roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see
                        how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half
                        speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make concentration check with
                        a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and
                        fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of
                        universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.

                        Alchemical Power Component
                        These sticky pouches can make a troublesome spell even worse.
                        Black Tentacles (M): For each tanglefoot bag used as a power component, you may reroll the
                        tentacles' grapple check against one creature of your choice.
                        Slow (M): For each tangelefoot bag used as a power component, you may designate one slowed
                        creature as being affected by a tanglefoot bag.
                        Web (M): Increase the DC of breaking free by making a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check by
                        1.

                    <description>You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it
                        strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a
                        sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or
                        be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4
                        penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component
                        that it tries to cast.

                        Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square.
                        Treat the target square as AC 5.

                        Alchemical Power Component
                        While they are effective enough on their own, these stones have useful interactions with some
                        spells.
                        Alarm (M): If cast as a mental alarm, you may have the spell activate a mental and audible
                        alarm. If cast as an audible alarm, the alarm is as loud as a thunderstone and affects creatures
                        in a 10-foot-radius spread as if a thunderstone had detonated there.
                        Glyph of Warding (M): Creatures that fail their saves against a blast glyph are also deafened as
                        if by a thunderstone.

                        against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify
                        these creatures.

                        At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may
                        select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any
                        one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

                        If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an
                        associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of
                        humanoid to choose from&#8212;those called out specifically on the table below are merely the
                        most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the
                        ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

                        class level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.

                        The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are
                        usually unfriendly.

                        To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that
                        they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an
                        animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less
                        time.

                        1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

                        The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered

                    <description>This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of
                        five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist
                        energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to
                        such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points
                        before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted
                        increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell
                        protects the recipient's equipment as well.

                        Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

                        Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy. If a character is
                        warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until
                        its power is exhausted.
