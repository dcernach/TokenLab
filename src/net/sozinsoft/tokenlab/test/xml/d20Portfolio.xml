                    <description>You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure
                        means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% of its actual value.
                        Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If
                        the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the
                        item's value.

                    <description>Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you.
                        You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty; increasing your speed imposes a
                        penalty depending on how fast you go. Noisy surfaces, such as bogs and undergrowth, are tough to
                        move silently across, and impose a further modifier.

                        Benefit: On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a
                        number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This
                        number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply
                        until your next turn.

                        Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two
                        hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can't add the bonus

                        treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double
                        weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a
                        two-handed weapon.)

                    <description>Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected weapon, base attack bonus +1.

                        Choose one type of weapon. You can also choose unarmed strike or grapple (or ray, if you are a
                        spellcaster) as your weapon for purposes of this feat.

                        Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.

                        Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the
                        feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
                        A fighter may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats. He must have Weapon Focus
                        with a weapon to gain the Weapon Specialization feat for that weapon.

                        ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
                        A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where
                        the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct
                        hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a
                        full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.
                        Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target
                        a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically
                        smothers the fire.
